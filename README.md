### Goals and opportunities


### Syllabus

- Introduction and basic definitions: algorithm, problem, instance.

- Computational complexity analysis of algorithms.

- Sorting: Mergesort, Quicksort and Heapsort.

### Exam
The exam consists of two parts.

- **Part 1**: Written Exam (up to 22 points)
  - 1-hour written exam covering topics discussed during the course.
  - Questions will assess the understanding of the core course materials.

- **Part 2**: Oral Exam on a Project (up to 8 points)
  - The project is based on a scientific paper from over 10 selected papers.
  - Students can approach the project at different levels of depth:
    - **Basic Level**: Read and understand the techniques presented in the article.
    - **Intermediate Level**: Conduct experiments to verify the assumptions, main properties,  or conclusions.
    - **Advanced Level**: Replicate the results from the article.
    - **Expert Level**: Re-implement the proposed solution, up to improving it by introducing alternative strategies.
