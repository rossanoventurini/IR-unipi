### Overview of Course
This Information Retrieval (IR) course focuses on modern techniques and technologies that efficiently retrieve and rank relevant data. It covers both foundational concepts and cutting-edge advancements, providing students with a deep understanding of how to manage and retrieve information in various applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and data management platforms. Here's a brief look at the course topics:

- **Language Properties and IR Models** – Introduction to how language and text are represented for retrieval, including traditional models (Boolean, vector space, and probabilistic) and modern IR models.
- **Effectiveness Measures** – Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and discounted cumulative gain (DCG) to measure IR system performance.
- **Efficiency with Modern CPUs** – Techniques to optimize IR systems to utilize modern CPUs, focusing on query processing and data retrieval speed.
- **Inverted Indexes and Query Processing** – Core indexing structures that allow fast lookups, including construction and optimization of inverted indexes for efficient query processing.
- **Data Compression** – Strategies for compressing indexes and data to save storage space while maintaining retrieval performance.
- **Learning-to-Rank (LTR)** – Machine learning models that rank documents based on relevance to queries. This involves feature extraction and model training to improve search results.
- **Efficient Inference of Learning-to-Rank Models** – Techniques to ensure that LTR models can be applied efficiently in large-scale, real-time environments.
- **Neural Information Retrieval** – Use of deep learning and neural networks to model semantic relevance and improve search capabilities beyond traditional methods.
- **Approximate k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) Search** – Algorithms for quickly finding approximate nearest neighbors, useful for large-scale vector-based retrieval systems.


### Opportunities
Becoming an expert in Information Retrieval offers numerous career opportunities with major companies that rely on search, ranking, and recommendation systems. This includes roles at search engine giants like Google and Microsoft, e-commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba, and media streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. Social media companies like Meta and LinkedIn also depend on IR expertise for content delivery and recommendations.
